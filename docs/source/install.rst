Installation
============

pip
---

To use ``pm4py`` on any OS, install it using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install pm4py

``pmp4y`` uses the ``Graphviz`` library for rendering visualizations.
Please install `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/download/>`_.

After installation, GraphViz is located in the ``program files`` directory. 
The ``bin\`` folder of the GraphViz directory needs to be added manually to the ``system path``.
