# PM4Py

PM4Py is a python library that supports state-of-the-art process mining algorithms in Python.
It is open source and intended to be used in both academia and industry projects.

PM4Py is managed and developed by PIS — Process Intelligence Solutions (https://processintelligence.solutions/),
a spin-off from the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT where PM4Py was initially developed.

## Licensing

The open-source version of PM4Py, available on GitHub (https://github.com/process-intelligence-solutions/pm4py), is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version
3 (**AGPL-3.0**).

We offer a separate version of PM4Py for **commercial use in closed-source environments** under a different license. For
more information about the licensing options for using PM4Py in closed-source settings, please
visit https://processintelligence.solutions/pm4py#licensing.

## Documentation / API

The documentation of PM4Py can be found at https://processintelligence.solutions/pm4py/.

## First Example

Here is a simple example to spark your interest:

```python
import pm4py

if __name__ == "__main__":
    log = pm4py.read_xes('<path-to-xes-log-file.xes>')
    net, initial_marking, final_marking = pm4py.discover_petri_net_inductive(log)
    pm4py.view_petri_net(net, initial_marking, final_marking, format="svg")
```

## Installation
PM4Py can be installed on Python 3.9.x / 3.10.x / 3.11.x / 3.12.x / 3.13.x / 3.14.x by invoking:

`pip install -U pm4py`

Optional features can be installed through extras. For example:

`pip install -U "pm4py[polars,ml]"`

Use `pip install -U "pm4py[all]"` to install every optional feature supported on the current platform.

For a reproducible installation using the exact dependency versions validated by the project, use:

`pip install -U "pm4py[stable]"`

PM4Py is also running on older Python environments with different requirements sets, including:

- Python 3.8 (3.8.10): `third_party/old_python_deps/requirements_py38.txt`

## Requirements

The default installation contains the dependencies needed for mainstream usage. Additional integrations are grouped by
feature in `pyproject.toml`:

* `calendars`: workalendar
* `connectors`: requests
* `llm`: openai and requests
* `ml`: pyemd and scikit-learn
* `ocel`: jsonschema and pyarrow
* `polars`: Polars dataframe support
* `solvers`: cvxopt
* `stable`: the exact dependency versions validated by the project and used by CI
* `visualization`: pyvis
* `windows`: pygetwindow, pynput, and pywin32 (Windows only)

For a source checkout, install the project with `python -m pip install -e .`. Build, CI, and lint dependencies are
standard dependency groups and can be installed with, for example, `python -m pip install --group lint`.

## Release Notes

To track the incremental updates, please refer to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
